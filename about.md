I am Fabien Andr√©. After completing a masters in
software engineering, I moved on to a PhD in multimedia databases. I
occasionally blog on my weekend projects or interesting issues I come across at
work.

Fond of system software, I am enthralled by compilers, databases and
distributed computing platforms (Hadoop, Spark and the likes). Over the last
years, I designed and implemented hardware-friendly algorithms, which lead me
to know SIMD instructions by heart or awkward details about processors. As I
never have enough, I am doing a [little bit of
VHDL](https://github.com/fandre90/fpga-projects) during my free time.

I am currently looking for research engineer or software engineer positions;
feel free to contact me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabienandre90).
