I am Xion345 — or Fabien André in real life. I am a failed
PhD student or, in other words, a software engineer struggling to deal with the
insanity of a PhD program. I occasionally blog on my weekend projects or 
interesting issues I come across at work.

Mostly interested in designing and implementing hardware-friendly algorithms, I 
am getting to know SIMD instructions by heart or awkward details about processors. 
I am also mildly obsessed about compilers, JIT compilers and large-scale computing 
platforms (Hadoop, Spark and the like). As I never have enough, I am doing a
[little bit of VHDL](https://github.com/Xion345/fpga-projects) during my free time.

I am all over the Internet, you can find me on:
