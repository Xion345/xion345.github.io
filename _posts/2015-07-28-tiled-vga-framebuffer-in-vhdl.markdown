This post shows how to implement a simple tiled VGA framebuffer in VHDL.
It allows an FPGA to display a picture on a screen, provided that the picture
is composed of repeated patterns, named *tiles*. Tiled framebuffers have much
lower memory requirements than direct framebuffers which makes it possible
to implement them using only the FPGA internal block RAM and without requiring
external memory elements. The tiled frambuffer presented in the post requires
35KiB of memory to display a picture on a 640x480 screen (8 bits per pixel)
where a classic pixel framebuffer would require 300KiB of memory.

You can see it in action below:

I implemented this project on a [Digilent Nexys 3](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,897&Prod=NEXYS3) board.
This board is equipped with (among others):

- A Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (XC6LX16-CS324)
- A *100Mhz* Clock
- A FT232 USB-UART Controller
- An *8-bit* VGA port

You should be able to adapt this project to other boards or FPGA quite easily,
provided that the same I/O devices are avaible. You will obviously have to change
FPGA pin assignement, but also adjust clock divisors if yours has a different
frequency.

## Project Overview ##

The full project allows transferring a picture from a computer over USB-UART to
the FPGA, whichs displays it on an external screen.

[Project photo with arrows]

The project is made up of the following elements:

- An UART component to receive and transmit data over the serial line
- An UART "DMA" This component manages a simple protocol layer allowing the
    computer to read and write to the VGA Frambuffer memory by sending commands
    over UART.
- A VGA Synchronisation circuit, which generates synchronisation signals
    required to drive the screen.
- A VGA Tiled Framebuffer which stores video data and transmits it to the
    screen.

Description of the UART and UART "DMA" components is outside the scope of this post,
but I might describe in upcoming posts. By constrast, we will show how the VGA
Synchronisation circuit and the VGA Framebuffer work in combination to display
pictures on the screen.

## VGA Video ##

### VGA Signals and Timings ###

Video information transmitted to the screen via a VGA port is conveyed by five
separate signals:

- Red
- Green
- Blue
- Hsync (Horizontal Synchronisation)
- Vsync (Vertical Synchronisation)

Red, green and blue are analog signals (0-0.7V), which respectively
represent the intensity of red, green and blue. The Digilent Nexys3 board
includes a simple resistor-based Digital to Analog Converter (DAC), so the FPGA
only has to output digital signals for the three colors. The DAC supports 3 bits
for red intensity, 3 bits for green intensity and 2 bits for blue intensity, so
8 bits pixel depth or 256 representable colors. Red, green and blue signals
evolve over time so that different colors are be displayed on different pixels.

The Hsync (Horizontal Synchronisation) and VSync (Vertical Synchronisation)
tell the screen that the FPGA has finished transmitting a line of
pixels, or a full screen, respectively.

Indeed, when the VGA interface was designed, screen were based on Cathode Ray
Tubes (CRT) and video information was displayed by sending three electron beams
to the back of the front surface of the screen. Each pixel on the screen was
composed of three "cells" — one for red, one for green, one for blue. The
red, green and blue signals controlled the amount of electrons sent to each
corresponding cell.

[VGA CRT Picture]

CRT screens shifted right the three electron beams by one pixel at each tick of the
*pixel clock* (or *pixel rate*).

### Obtaining VGA Timing Information ###

This is the easy part, right? Well not quite. VGA timings are standardized and
published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA — you probably have
heard this name before), but you have to pay to obtain these specifications. But you
know what might have happened? Some people might have bought the VESA specification, and
received an nice PDF. And they might have uploaded it to their FTP, because you know,
an FTP is convenient to share documents with your coworkers. And the FTP contents might
be exposed over HTTP to the whole Internet. And content might have been indexed by Google.
Just speculating here, but this kind of stuff could have happened.

Alternatively, there are a number of websites which list common timings and present the
information in an easy-to-use way. Among them, I would strongly recommend
[TinyVGA](http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing). You may also be able to find this information in
your monitor manual.

<!-- EDID -->
<!-- Dire que ça simplifie la configuration de l'ordianteur -->
Fairly recent monitors are able to transmit the list of VGA timings they support to
the host graphics adapter via a standard called EDID (Extended Display Identification Data).
We cannot read EDID from the FPGA because it is transmitted via pin 4,11,12 and 15 of the
VGA connector, which are unconnected on the Digilent Nexys3 board
([EDID - Extron Electronics](http://www.extron.com/company/article.aspx?id=uedid)). Besides, EDID packets
are somewhat tedious to parse. However, it is possible to read your monitor EDID information
from your computer, which is probably the easiest way to retrieve the list of VGA timings
your monitor supports. Under Linux/Xorg, you can use `xrandr --verbose`
to do so :

### Principles ###

Direct framebuffers (or bitmap framebuffers) simply contain the color associated
with each pixel of the screen. They offer the best versality — they allow displaying
absolutely any picture — but they have rather high memory requirements:

    direct_frambuffer_mem = screen_width * screen_height * pixel_depth
    # 640x480 - 1 Byte per pixel (8 bits)
    direct_frambuffer_mem = 640 * 480 * 1 = 300 KiB
    # 800x600 - 1 Byte per pixel (8 bits)
    direct_frambuffer_mem = 800 * 600 * 1 = ~469 KiB

It would be possible to implement a direct framebuffer on the Digilent Nexys3 using the
external 16MB CellularRAM, but it would require designing a RAM controller. Moreover,
using the CellularRAM as a direct framebuffer would consume an important part of
the memory bandwidth, which would not be available for other components such as a CPU.

FPGAs include easy-to-use synchronous memory named Block RAM, but it comes in limited
capacity. The Spartan-6 XC6SLX16 FPGA on the Digilent Nexys3 has 576Kbit Block RAM,
or 72KiB ([Spartan 6 Product Table](http://www.xilinx.com/publications/prod_mktg/Spartan6_Product_Table.pdf)).
It is thus impossible to implement a direct framebuffer using the FPGA Block RAM.

Tiled framebuffer have lower memory requirements than direct framebuffers, which makes
it possible to implement them using Block RAM. They were used on old game consoles,
such as the GameBoy ([GameBoy Graphics](http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-Graphics)),
when large amounts of memory were not cheap.

Tiled frambuffers divide the screen into *zones* and display a *tile* (or pattern) chosen
from a bank on each zone. In this project we use 8x16 pixels *tiles* and *zones*
(zones and tiles are always the same size), and the bank holds 256 tiles. A tiled framebuffer
stores the *index* (or *reference*) of the tile which should be displayed in each zone in an
*index memory*. It also stores all tiles, ie the colors of all pixels of each tile in a
*tile memory*.

[Image divided into tiles]

The memory requirements of a tiled framebuffer are as follows

    # 256 tiles
    nb_tiles = 256 # Number of different tiles
    bit_width(x) -> Number of bits necessary to represent x
    bit_width(nb_tiles) = 8 bits = 1 Byte

    # 8x16 tiles
    tile_width = 8
    tile_height = 16
    tile_size = tile_width*tile_height = 8*16 = 128 B

    # 640x480 screen
    # Width of the screen in zones
    nb_zones_width = screen_width/tile_width = 80
    # Height of the screen in tiles
    nb_zones_height = screen_height/tile_height = 30

    # Index memory
    # Stores the index (reference) of the tile displayed
    # in each zone
    # 1 Byte in the size of 1 index, ie bit_width(nb_tiles)
    index_mem = nb_zones_width * nb_zones_height * 1
              = 80 * 30
              = ~2.4 KiB

    # Tiles memory
    # Stores the colors of each pixels of each of the 256 tiles
    tiles_mem = nb_tiles * tile_width * tile_height * 1
              = 256 * 8 * 16
              = 32 KiB

    # Total memory
    tiled_framebuffer_mem = index_mem + tiles_mem
                          = 32 KiB + 2.4 KiB
                          = 34.4 KiB
